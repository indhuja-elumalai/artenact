# 🌸 Artenact: The Heritage AI Platform for Indian Artisans

**"Artisans focus on crafting, AI handles storytelling, design, and selling."**

### 📌 Problem Statement

India is home to over 50 million artisans and craftsmen, custodians of priceless traditional skills and cultural heritage. However, they face immense challenges in the modern digital marketplace, including:

* **Lack of Digital Skills:** Limited knowledge of marketing and e-commerce.
* **Invisible Value:** Difficulty in conveying the rich cultural narrative behind their products, which are often devalued by cheap, mass-produced copies.
* **Marketplace Disconnect:** A widening gap between traditional art forms and digitally-native consumers.

These challenges threaten the sustainability of unique art forms and the livelihoods of their creators.

### 🚀 Solution – The "Heritage AI" Platform

Artenact is a ground-breaking AI-powered platform that acts as a digital archivist and creative collaborator for local artisans. We empower them to:

* **Digitize their craft:** Create a professional digital footprint instantly.
* **Tell their authentic story:** Weave the heritage of their craft into compelling, shareable content.
* **Sell directly to a global audience:** Connect with buyers who value authenticity and emotional connection.

Built entirely on **Google Cloud's Generative AI** (Vertex AI, Gemini, Imagen, Translation API), Artenact harmonizes traditional craftsmanship with modern consumer trends.

### ✨ Key Features (Hackathon MVP)

Our prototype focuses on the core "Heritage Capsule" and "AI Storyteller" features:

* **📝 AI Story & Content Generator:** An artisan records an audio story about their craft in their native language. Our backend uses **Google's Speech-to-Text** and **Translation API** to transcribe and translate it. **Vertex AI's Gemini Pro** then crafts polished product descriptions, emotional narratives, and social media captions with relevant hashtags.
* **🔮 Heritage Capsule:** We preserve the artisan's original audio story and pair it with the AI-generated text. This "capsule" serves as a unique, interactive digital archive that accompanies every product, giving buyers an authentic, emotional connection to the artisan and their heritage.

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture (Google Cloud)

* **Frontend:** A modern, responsive web application built with **Next.js** or **React** for a fast, mobile-first experience.
* **Backend:** A serverless API powered by **Cloud Functions** or **Cloud Run**. This ensures a scalable and cost-effective solution for handling API calls from the front-end to various GCP services.
* **AI/ML:** Our core pipeline leverages **Vertex AI's Gemini Pro** for text generation, **Speech-to-Text API** for transcription, and **Translation API** for multi-lingual support.
* **Storage:** **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** for securely storing audio recordings and images uploaded by the artisans.
* **Database:** **Firestore** for managing artisan profiles and product data.

### 🔄 User Flow (Prototype Demo)

1.  **Artisan Records:** The artisan uses their phone to record a short audio clip in their local dialect, describing their craft.
2.  **AI Processes:** The backend automatically transcribes, translates, and generates a rich, contextual story in seconds.
3.  **Heritage Capsule is Born:** The prototype displays the new product page, showing the generated text alongside an audio player for the original story.
4.  **Instant Marketability:** The artisan can now share this professional-grade product page and its generated social captions on any platform.

### 🚀 Future Roadmap (Post-Hackathon)

Our vision extends far beyond this MVP. Future additions to the platform will include:

* **🎨 Generative Design Studio:** Use **Vertex AI's Imagen** to help artisans create professional-looking product photos and mockups from a single image.
* **🛒 Integrated E-Commerce:** One-click publishing to marketplaces like Etsy or social platforms like Instagram and Threads, with AI-driven insights on what sells.
* **📊 Trend Analytics:** An AI dashboard that suggests trending colors, patterns, and keywords to help artisans align their new creations with global consumer trends without compromising their traditional techniques.
* **🌍 Multi-lingual Reach:** Fully-automated translation of product descriptions and an AI-powered conversational assistant to help artisans communicate with buyers globally.

### 2. `.env.example`

Create this file in both the `frontend` and `backend` folders for a professional setup.

.env.example
This file is a template for your environment variables.
NEVER commit your actual .env file to Git.
--- GCP Configuration ---
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
GCP_REGION=us-central1

--- AI API Configuration ---
Use base64 encoded service account key for production,
but for local dev, you can use the path to the key file.
To get the base64 string: cat your-key-file.json | base64
Recommended for GitHub Actions secrets.
GCP_SA_KEY_BASE64=your-base64-encoded-key

Vertex AI Model IDs
For text generation, Gemini Pro is a great choice.
